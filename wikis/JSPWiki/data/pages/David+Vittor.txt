Hi All,

I'm a senior [Java|https://www.oracle.com/java/index.html] developer, located in [Sydney, Australia|https://www.google.com.au/maps/@-33.7969235,150.9224326,10z], and am intersted in getting involved in this project. I have a pretty good background with [Confluence Wiki|https://www.atlassian.com/software/confluence].

Not quite sure how I can help just yet, or how much time I can devote, but I am looking forward to see how I can volunteer to make this project better.

I've managed to get the source code, to compile it, edit it in both [Eclipse|https://www.eclipse.org/] and [Android Studio|https://developer.android.com/sdk/installing/studio.html], deployed it to [Tomcat|http://tomcat.apache.org/], and built a few plugins.

!Hosting
* I have launched my JSPWiki here - [http://digitalspider.com.au/JSPWiki]
* Although I plan to create another one on __OpenShift__ See [https://jspwiki-wiki.apache.org/Wiki.jsp?page=JSPWikiPublications] and migrate my current mediawiki to jspwiki.

!Plugins
Check out my list of plugins here:
* [http://digitalspider.com.au/JSPWiki/Wiki.jsp?page=Plugins]

* [PanelPlugin]
* [AutoLinkHtmlFilter]
* [EncryptedPageFilter]
* FileSystemProvider - persist page attributes as page properties. Completed in [https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/JSPWIKI-856]

!Roadmap
On my "to do soon" roadmap is:
* AttachmentsPlugin - lists attachments on the page even in readonly mode (so you dont have to use the tab).
* PasswordPlugin - a way to encrypt passwords and place them in the wiki
* VideoEmbedFilter - automatically embed [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ndfyn0y9B0] or [http://vimeo.com/30998268]
* JDBCProvider - persist content to a database - Hibernate ORM
* OrientDBPageProvider - graph database [http://www.orientechnologies.com/orientdb/] or [http://www.neo4j.org/]

!Advanced
Some of the other things I would love to see in this wiki are:
* UI for Administration pages - a way to edit the jspwiki.properties through a form
* OSGi for plugins - [Apache Felix iPOJO|http://felix.apache.org/documentation/subprojects/apache-felix-ipojo.html]
* UI for ACL controls - Edit/View controls for users / groups
* CKEditor as a WYSIWIG editor
* Hibernate / Jackrabbit / Database storage
* Spaces
* Macro/Plugin browser
* Theme/Skin management
* Mobile UI
