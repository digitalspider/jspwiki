Hi All,

I'm a senior Java developer, located in Sydney, Australia, and am intersted in getting involved in this project. I have a pretty good background with Confluence (my 2nd brain).

Not quite sure how I can help just yet, or how much time I can devote, but I am looking forward to see how I can volunteer to make this project better.

I've just managed to get the source code to compile, put it in eclispe, deployed it to Tomcat, and built the TreePlugin.

!!Testing the RPCSamplePlugin

Whoohoo now I have my own JSPWiki running on localhost!

To set this up on __OpenShift__ See [https://jspwiki-wiki.apache.org/Wiki.jsp?page=JSPWikiPublications]. Now I just need to migrate my current mediawiki to jspwiki.
