I've been interested recently in IT System Standards, such as:

    ITIL
        http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_Technology_Infrastructure_Library
        http://www.itil-officialsite.com/
    ISO 20000 (ISO20k)
        http://www.itgovernance.co.uk/iso20000.aspx#.VAZmz2Oyq2o
        http://www.iso.org/iso/catalogue_detail?csnumber=51986
        http://en.it-processmaps.com/itil/iso-20000.html
    IEFT OAuth 2 - http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749
    IEFT XMPP - http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3920.txt - http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3921.txt

And this brought me to doing some investigation into Java based open source software (mostly Apache).

This led me to discover WSO2 a middleware that is provided as open source. Here are some interesting links:

A competitor is also UltraESB:
